 What i have learnt on Python variables
-they are containers for storing data values.
-i learnt that python has no command for creating variables ,like in lets say in js where we have var=4,in python we don't have any command for creating variables.
-A variable is created when you first assign a value into it,that is when a variable is created.
-An example is.
      a=3
      b=4
  print(a)
  print(b)
Also in variable you don't have to declare a specific type,you can use different types like an int and a string.
If you want to specify a data type you can do that..an example is
   x=str(3)
   y=int(4) 
print(x)-3 will be printed as a string.
print(y)-y will be printed as an integer.
-You can also get the data type of a variable using the type function eg
  x=4
y=”jane”
print(type(x)
print(type(y)
Also in python variables:
    -name of the variable must not start with a number.
    -name of the variable must start with a letter or underscores.
    -variable names are case sensitive like for example a variable name called language,and the other one called  LANGUAGE,those are two different variables.
    
    
    I also learnt how to add a readme..have never used it ,i didnt know where it was but i managed to get it.am glad.
